SDLC vs TDLC – V-Model & Agile QA Integration


Task 1


9. V-Model Mapping

The V-Model establishes a relationship between each Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) phase and its corresponding Testing Development Life Cycle (TDLC) phase.


                 SDLC                           TDLC

        Requirements -----------------> Acceptance Testing

        System Design -----------------> System Testing

        Architecture Design -----------> Integration Testing

        Module Design -----------------> Unit Testing

                     \               /
                      \             /
                        Coding



SDLC ↔ TDLC Mapping


SDLC Phase: Requirements

Corresponding TDLC Phase: Acceptance Testing

Test Artifact Produced: Acceptance Test Plan



SDLC Phase: System Design

Corresponding TDLC Phase: System Testing

Test Artifact Produced: System Test Plan



SDLC Phase: Architecture Design

Corresponding TDLC Phase: Integration Testing

Test Artifact Produced: Integration Test Plan



SDLC Phase: Module Design

Corresponding TDLC Phase: Unit Testing

Test Artifact Produced: Unit Test Cases



SDLC Phase: Coding

Corresponding TDLC Phase: Execution of Tests

Test Artifact Produced: Source Code




10. Test Artifacts Produced


Requirements Phase

- Acceptance Test Plan
- Requirement Review Checklist


System Design Phase

- System Test Plan
- Test Scenarios


Architecture Design Phase

- Integration Test Plan
- Interface Test Cases


Module Design Phase

- Unit Test Cases
- Module Test Plan


Coding Phase

- Source Code
- Executable Build




11. Entry and Exit Criteria


Testing Level: Unit Testing

Entry Criteria:
Module coding completed

Exit Criteria:
All unit tests passed, no critical defects


Testing Level: Integration Testing

Entry Criteria:
Unit testing completed successfully

Exit Criteria:
Interfaces tested successfully, no major defects


Testing Level: System Testing

Entry Criteria:
Integrated application available

Exit Criteria:
All planned test cases executed, critical defects resolved


Testing Level: Acceptance Testing

Entry Criteria:
System testing completed

Exit Criteria:
Customer acceptance obtained and application approved




12. QA Engagement in the V-Model


1. Requirements Review

QA reviews the requirements to ensure they are clear, complete, consistent, and testable before development begins.


2. Design Review

QA participates in reviewing the system design and architecture to identify potential risks and prepare test scenarios before coding starts.




Task 2


13. Problems in Waterfall Testing


In the Waterfall model, testing starts only after development is completed. This creates several problems:


Problem 1

Defects are discovered very late, making them more expensive and time-consuming to fix.


Problem 2

Requirement misunderstandings remain unnoticed until testing begins, leading to rework.


Problem 3

Testing time is limited because development delays reduce the available testing schedule.




14. QA Role in Agile Ceremonies


Sprint Planning

- Understand user stories.
- Define acceptance criteria.
- Estimate testing effort.
- Identify testing requirements.


Daily Stand-up

- Share testing progress.
- Report blockers.
- Discuss defects.
- Coordinate with developers.


Sprint Review

- Verify completed features.
- Demonstrate tested functionality.
- Validate acceptance criteria.


Sprint Retrospective

- Discuss testing challenges.
- Suggest process improvements.
- Improve collaboration within the team.




15. Shift-Left Testing Practices


a) Requirement Review

QA reviews requirements early to ensure they are complete, clear, and testable before development begins.


b) Writing Test Cases Before Coding (TDD/BDD)

QA prepares test cases and acceptance criteria before developers start coding, reducing misunderstandings.


c) Static Code Analysis

Developers use static analysis tools to identify coding issues before executing the application.


d) API Contract Testing

QA validates API specifications and endpoint contracts before integrating different modules.




16. Acceptance Criteria (Given–When–Then)


Scenario 1 – Happy Path


Given the college administrator is logged into the Course Management System


When valid course details are entered and the Create button is clicked


Then the course should be created successfully and a confirmation message should be displayed.




Scenario 2 – Duplicate Course Code


Given a course with the same course code already exists


When the administrator attempts to create another course using the same course code


Then the system should display an error message indicating that the course code already exists.




Scenario 3 – Missing Required Fields


Given the administrator is on the Create Course page


When one or more mandatory fields are left empty and the Create button is clicked


Then the system should display validation messages and prevent the course from being created.




Conclusion


This hands-on provided an understanding of the relationship between SDLC and TDLC through the V-Model. It also explained entry and exit criteria, QA involvement throughout the software development lifecycle, Agile QA practices, Shift-Left testing, and writing acceptance criteria using the Given-When-Then format. These concepts help ensure better software quality and support effective test planning from the early stages of development.

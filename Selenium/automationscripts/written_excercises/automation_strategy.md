Hands-On 3

Test Automation Process, Lifecycle & Framework Types


Task 1


17. Criteria for Deciding Whether a Test Case Should Be Automated

The following are five important criteria for selecting test cases for automation. The example used is:

Scenario: Test that the POST /api/courses/ endpoint returns HTTP 201 and correct course data when valid input is provided.


1. Repetitive Execution

Tests executed frequently should be automated because they save time.

Application:
The POST API is executed during every regression cycle, making it a good automation candidate.


2. Stable Functionality

Features that rarely change are suitable for automation.

Application:
The POST endpoint is a core API and is unlikely to change frequently.


3. High Business Priority

Critical business features should always be automated.

Application:
Creating a course is one of the main functionalities of the Course Management API.


4. Data-Driven Testing

Tests requiring multiple input combinations are ideal for automation.

Application:
Different course names, IDs, durations, and instructors can be tested automatically.


5. Time Saving

Automation reduces manual effort for repetitive tests.

Application:
Instead of manually testing the POST endpoint after every release, automated execution completes within seconds.


18. Test Case Selection

Test Case: Regression testing of all CRUD endpoints
Decision: Automate
Justification: Frequently executed after every code change.

Test Case: Exploratory testing of new search feature
Decision: Manual
Justification: Requires human observation and creativity.

Test Case: Performance testing with 100 concurrent users
Decision: Automate
Justification: Performance tools can simulate multiple users efficiently.

Test Case: UI Login Test
Decision: Automate
Justification: Login is executed in almost every testing cycle.

Test Case: Verify Swagger Documentation
Decision: Manual
Justification: Documentation changes occasionally and requires human verification.

Test Case: Smoke Test after deployment
Decision: Automate
Justification: Quick validation after every deployment saves time.


19. Test Automation ROI

Definition

Return on Investment (ROI) measures whether the time and effort spent creating automated tests are recovered through repeated execution.


Given:

Automation Development = 4 hours

Manual Execution = 30 minutes (0.5 hour)


ROI Calculation

Automation Cost:

4 hours


Manual Execution Cost:

0.5 hour per execution


Break-even Point:

4 ÷ 0.5 = 8 executions


Therefore, automation becomes beneficial after 8 executions.


Maintenance Cost

After the 10th execution:

20% of 0.5 hour = 0.1 hour


Total execution time after 10 runs:

0.5 + 0.1 = 0.6 hour


Even after maintenance, automation remains cost-effective because it saves significant manual effort.


20. Flaky Test

Definition:

A flaky test is a test that sometimes passes and sometimes fails without any changes in the application.


Example:

A Selenium test clicks the Login button before the page finishes loading.

Sometimes the test passes, sometimes it fails.


Strategies to Prevent Flaky Tests:

1. Use Explicit Waits instead of Thread.sleep().

2. Use stable element locators such as ID or Name.

3. Maintain test independence so tests do not rely on previous executions.



Task 2


21. Automation Framework Types


Linear Framework

Description:

Tests are written in a single script and executed sequentially.


Advantage:

Simple to understand and develop.


Disadvantage:

Poor code reuse and difficult maintenance.


Course Management Example:

Testing only the login feature in a small project.



Modular Framework

Description:

The application is divided into reusable modules.


Advantage:

Reusable code and easier maintenance.


Disadvantage:

Requires planning during framework design.


Course Management Example:

Separate modules for Login, Courses, Students, and Faculty.



Data-Driven Framework

Description:

Test data is stored externally in Excel, CSV, or JSON files.


Advantage:

Same test script works with multiple data sets.


Disadvantage:

Managing external data files increases complexity.


Course Management Example:

Testing login using 50 different usernames and passwords.



Keyword-Driven Framework

Description:

Tests are created using keywords representing actions.


Advantage:

Non-technical testers can create test cases.


Disadvantage:

Framework implementation is more complex.


Course Management Example:

Keywords such as Login, ClickButton, CreateCourse.



Hybrid Framework

Description:

Combines Modular, Data-Driven, and Keyword-Driven approaches.


Advantage:

Highly reusable, flexible, and scalable.


Disadvantage:

Initial development takes more time.


Course Management Example:

Large Selenium automation project covering all Course Management features.



22. Recommended Framework

Recommendation:

A Hybrid Framework combining:

- Modular Framework
- Data-Driven Framework
- Keyword-Driven Framework


Justification:

- Supports 50 different login credentials using external test data.
- Login functionality can be reused across multiple test cases.
- Non-technical team members can write keyword-based test scenarios.
- Easier maintenance for large automation projects.

Explanation:

- config stores project configuration.
- test_data stores Excel and CSV files.
- page_objects contains Selenium Page Object classes.
- utilities contains reusable helper methods.
- test_cases contains Selenium test scripts.
- reports stores test execution reports.
- screenshots stores failed test screenshots.



Conclusion

This hands-on explained how to decide which test cases should be automated, how automation provides return on investment (ROI), and how flaky tests can be prevented. It also compared five automation framework types—Linear, Modular, Data-Driven, Keyword-Driven, and Hybrid—and recommended a Hybrid Framework for the Course Management System because it offers reusability, scalability, and maintainability for real-world Selenium automation projects.

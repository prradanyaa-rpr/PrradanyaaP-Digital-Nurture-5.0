Hands-On 1

QA Concepts, Functional Testing & Defect Lifecycle


Task 1


1. Testing Types for the Course Management API


Unit Testing

Test Case:

Verify that the function validate_course_name() correctly validates the course name.


Example:

Input: "Python"

Expected Output: Valid


Testing Type: Functional Testing



Integration Testing

Test Case:

Verify that the POST /api/courses endpoint successfully stores the course details in the database.


Components Tested:

- API Endpoint
- Database


Testing Type: Functional Testing



System Testing

Test Case:

Create a new course using the API and retrieve it using the GET endpoint to verify the complete end-to-end workflow.


Testing Type: Functional Testing



User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Test Case:

A college administrator logs into the application, creates a new course, edits the course information, and verifies that the updated course is displayed correctly.


Testing Type: Functional Testing



2. Functional and Non-Functional Testing

The above four test cases are examples of Functional Testing because they verify whether the application performs the required functionality correctly.


Example of Non-Functional Testing


Performance Testing

Verify that the Course Management API responds within 2 seconds when 500 users send requests simultaneously.



3. Black-Box Testing vs White-Box Testing


Black-Box Testing

Black-box testing verifies the functionality of an application without knowing its internal source code.


Example:

Testing the POST /api/courses endpoint by sending requests and verifying the response.



White-Box Testing

White-box testing verifies the internal code, logic, conditions, loops, and program structure.


Example:

Testing the internal validation function validate_course_name().



Who Performs Them?

- QA Testers generally perform Black-Box Testing.
- Developers generally perform White-Box Testing.



4. Formal Test Cases


Test Case ID: TC001

Description: Create a new course

Preconditions: API server is running

Test Steps: Send a POST request with valid course details

Expected Result: Course is created successfully with HTTP Status Code 201 (Created)

Actual Result:

Pass/Fail:



Test Case ID: TC002

Description: Create a course with an empty name

Preconditions: API server is running

Test Steps: Send a POST request with an empty course name

Expected Result: API returns 400 Bad Request with a validation error

Actual Result:

Pass/Fail:



Test Case ID: TC003

Description: Create a duplicate course

Preconditions: Course already exists

Test Steps: Send a POST request with the same course name

Expected Result: API returns a duplicate course error message

Actual Result:

Pass/Fail:




Task 2


5. Defect Lifecycle


The defect lifecycle describes the different stages a defect goes through from identification to closure.


New
  ↓
Assigned
  ↓
Open
  ↓
Fixed
  ↓
Retest
  ↓
Verified
  ↓
Closed


Explanation of Each Stage


New:

The defect is identified and reported by the QA tester.


Assigned:

The defect is assigned to a developer for analysis and fixing.


Open:

The developer starts working on resolving the defect.


Fixed:

The developer fixes the defect and marks it as fixed.


Retest:

The QA tester retests the application to verify the fix.


Verified:

The tester confirms that the defect has been fixed successfully.


Closed:

The defect is closed after successful verification.



Alternate Paths


Rejected:

- The developer rejects the defect because it is invalid, cannot be reproduced, or is not considered a bug.


Deferred:

- The defect is accepted but postponed to a future release because it is not critical or due to project constraints.




6. Severity and Priority Classification


Bug:

POST /api/courses returns 500 Internal Server Error for all requests

Severity:

Critical

Priority:

P1

Justification:

The API is completely unusable because users cannot create courses. It must be fixed immediately.



Bug:

Course names longer than 150 characters are silently truncated without an error

Severity:

Medium

Priority:

P2

Justification:

The application continues to work, but data is lost, affecting data integrity.



Bug:

The /docs Swagger page has a typo in the API description

Severity:

Low

Priority:

P4

Justification:

This is a documentation issue and does not affect the application's functionality.



Bug:

Login with correct credentials occasionally returns 401 Unauthorized on the first attempt

Severity:

High

Priority:

P1

Justification:

Users cannot reliably log in. Since the issue is intermittent, it may indicate a deeper system problem and should be fixed urgently.




7. Defect Report


Defect ID:

BUG-001


Title:

POST /api/courses returns 500 Internal Server Error


Environment:

- Windows 11
- Python 3.x
- VS Code
- Google Chrome


Build Version:

v1.0


Severity:

Critical


Priority:

P1



Steps to Reproduce:

1. Start the Course Management API.
2. Open Postman or Swagger UI.
3. Send a POST request to /api/courses with valid course details.
4. Observe the response.



Expected Result:

The API should create a new course successfully and return HTTP Status Code 201 (Created).



Actual Result:

The API returns HTTP Status Code 500 (Internal Server Error), and the course is not created.



Attachments:

- Screenshot of the 500 Internal Server Error.




8. Difference Between Severity and Priority


Severity

Severity indicates how seriously a defect affects the application's functionality.


Priority

Priority indicates how urgently a defect should be fixed.



Example:

A spelling mistake on the CEO's dashboard has Low Severity because it does not affect the application's functionality. However, it has High Priority because it is highly visible and should be corrected before the software is released.


Another example is a rarely used feature that crashes the application. It has High Severity because it affects functionality but may have Low Priority if very few users use that feature.




Conclusion


This hands-on helped in understanding the fundamentals of Quality Assurance, including testing levels, functional and non-functional testing, black-box and white-box testing, defect lifecycle, severity and priority classification, defect reporting, and formal test case writing. These concepts provide a strong foundation for learning Selenium test automation in the upcoming hands-on exercises.
